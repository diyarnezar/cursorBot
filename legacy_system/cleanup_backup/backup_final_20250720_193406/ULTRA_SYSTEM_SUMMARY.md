All features are robustly aggregated, deduplicated, and cached for reliability.

### API Rate Limit Handling & Best Practices
- **All API calls are rate-limited and cached** to respect each provider's free tier and avoid hitting limits or causing waiting errors.
- **SmartDataCollector** and **EnhancedAlternativeData** use:
  - Per-API rate limiters (e.g., Finnhub: 60/min, Twelve Data: 8/min)
  - Caching of results for repeated use within the allowed window
  - Fallbacks to alternative sources or cached data if a limit is reached
- **Training and live trading** are designed to:
  - Use the freshest data available without exceeding API quotas
  - Prefer high-limit/unlimited APIs for frequent polling, and use lower-limit APIs for periodic intelligence boosts
  - Aggregate and deduplicate data from all sources for maximum intelligence
- **If an API is temporarily unavailable or rate-limited, the system will gracefully fallback to cached or alternative data, ensuring uninterrupted operation.**
