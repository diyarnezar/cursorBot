## Project Hyperion - Seamless Training Control

This guide explains how to use the pause/resume functionality to control your training sessions.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start Training with Pause/Resume
```bash
python pause_resume_training.py start
```

### 2. Check Training Status
```bash
python pause_resume_training.py status
```

### 3. Pause Training
```bash
python pause_resume_training.py pause
```

### 4. Resume Training
```bash
python pause_resume_training.py resume
```

### 5. Monitor Progress in Real-Time
```bash
python pause_resume_training.py monitor
```

### 6. Stop Training
```bash
python pause_resume_training.py stop
```

## 📊 Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `start` | Start training process |
| `pause` | Pause training at safe checkpoint |
| `resume` | Resume training from checkpoint |
| `stop` | Stop training completely |
| `status` | Check current training status |
| `monitor` | Monitor progress in real-time |

## 🔧 How It Works

### ✅ **Automatic Checkpoint Saving**
- Checkpoints saved every 5 minutes automatically
- No data loss during pause/resume
- Training resumes from exact same point

### ✅ **Safe Pause Points**
- Training pauses at safe checkpoints only
- No interruption during critical operations
- Models and data preserved completely

### ✅ **Cross-Platform Support**
- Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- Signal-based on Unix systems
- File-based on Windows systems

## 📈 Status Information

When you run `python pause_resume_training.py status`, you'll see:

```
📊 Training Status:
   Running: True/False
   PID: Process ID
   Progress: 45.2%
   Current Step: Model Training
   Models Trained: 23/64
   Estimated Remaining: ~4-6 hours remaining
   Status: active/paused
```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Start Training and Go Out
```bash
# Start training
python pause_resume_training.py start

# Check status
python pause_resume_training.py status

# Go out, training continues...

# When you return, check status
python pause_resume_training.py status

# If you need to pause
python pause_resume_training.py pause
```

### Example 2: Monitor Long Training Session
```bash
# Start training
python pause_resume_training.py start

# Monitor progress in real-time
python pause_resume_training.py monitor

# Press Ctrl+C to stop monitoring
```

### Example 3: Resume After Interruption
```bash
# Check if training was interrupted
python pause_resume_training.py status

# If it shows "paused" status, resume
python pause_resume_training.py resume

# Monitor to see it's working
python pause_resume_training.py monitor
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Training Won't Start
```bash
# Check if another training is running
python pause_resume_training.py status

# If running, stop it first
python pause_resume_training.py stop

# Then start new training
python pause_resume_training.py start
```

### Can't Pause/Resume
```bash
# Check if training is actually running
python pause_resume_training.py status

# If not running, start it first
python pause_resume_training.py start
```

### Checkpoint Issues
```bash
# Check checkpoint directory
ls checkpoints/

# If corrupted, delete checkpoint files
rm checkpoints/*.json checkpoints/*.pkl checkpoints/*.txt

# Start fresh training
python pause_resume_training.py start
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Always Check Status First**
Before any operation, check the current status:
```bash
python pause_resume_training.py status
```

### 2. **Use Monitor for Long Sessions**
For long training sessions, use the monitor:
```bash
python pause_resume_training.py monitor
```

### 3. **Pause Before System Updates**
If you need to update your system:
```bash
python pause_resume_training.py pause
# Do system updates
python pause_resume_training.py resume
```

### 4. **Resume After Power Outage**
If power goes out during training:
```bash
python pause_resume_training.py status
# If it shows progress, resume
python pause_resume_training.py resume
```
